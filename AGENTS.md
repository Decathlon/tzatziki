# Tzatziki Project Overview

Tzatziki is a comprehensive library of Cucumber step definitions and testing utilities designed to accelerate and simplify Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) for Java and Spring-based applications.

## Purpose

The library provides ready-to-use steps for common infrastructure and application layers, including:
- **HTTP/REST**: Mocking servers and asserting on request/response interactions.
- **Spring Data/JPA**: Managing database state and verifying persistence.
- **Kafka**: Producing and consuming messages for asynchronous testing.
- **OpenSearch/MongoDB**: Integrated steps for NoSQL and search engine validations.
- **Logging**: Asserting on application logs.
- **MCP (Model Context Protocol)**: Support for AI-integrated testing environments.

By using Tzatziki, developers can write expressive, high-level Gherkin scenarios without having to manually implement repetitive infrastructure "glue" code.

## Reference Documentation

For a complete example of all implemented Cucumber steps currently available in the library, please refer to the following auto-generated documentation:

This file contains the full context of step patterns and their usage, which is particularly useful for LLMs and AI agents to understand the available DSL (Domain Specific Language) of the project.
