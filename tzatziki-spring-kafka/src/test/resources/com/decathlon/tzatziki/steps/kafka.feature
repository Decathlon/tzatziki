Feature: to interact with a spring boot service having a connection to a kafka queue

  Background:
    * a com.decathlon logger set to DEBUG
    Given this avro schema:
      """yml
      type: record
      name: user
      fields:
        - name: id
          type: int
        - name: name
          type: string
      """

  Scenario: we can push an avro message in a kafka topic where a listener expect a simple payload
    When this user is consumed from the users topic:
      """yml
      id: 1
      name: bob
      """
    Then we have received 1 message on the topic users

  Scenario: we can push a list of avro messages as a table in a kafka topic where a listener expect a simple payload
    When these users are consumed from the users topic:
      | id | name |
      | 1  | bob  |
      | 2  | lisa |
    Then we have received 2 messages on the topic users

  Scenario: we can push a json message in a kafka topic where a listener expect a simple payload
    When this json message is consumed from the json-users-input topic:
      """yml
      id: 1
      name: bob
      """
    Then we have received 1 message on the topic json-users-input

  Scenario: we can push a message in a kafka topic where a listener expects a list of payload, topic, partition, offset
    When these users are consumed from the users-with-headers topic:
      """yml
      - id: 1

    Then we have received 12 messages on the topic users-with-headers

  Scenario Template: replaying a topic should only be replaying the messages received in this test
    When this user is consumed from the users-with-headers topic:
      """yml
      id: 3
      name: tom
      """
    Then we have received 1 message on the topic users-with-headers

    And if we empty the logs
    And that we replay the topic users-with-headers from <from> with a <method>

    Then within 10000ms we have received 2 messages on the topic users-with-headers
    And the logs contain:
      """yml
      - "?e .*received user on users-with-headers-0@0: \\{\"id\": 3, \"name\": \"tom\"}"
      """
    # these messages are from the previous test and shouldn't leak
    But it is not true that the logs contain:
      """yml
      - "?e .*received user on users-with-headers-\\d@\\d+: \\{\"id\": 1, \"name\": \"bob\"}"
      - "?e .*received user on users-with-headers-\\d@\\d+: \\{\"id\": 2, \"name\": \"lisa\"}"
      """

    Examples:

      | the beginning | listener |
      | the beginning | consumer |
      | offset 0      | listener |
      | offset 0      | consumer |

  Scenario Outline: we can set the offset of a given group-id on a given topic
    When these users are consumed from the users-with-headers topic:
      """yml
      - id: 1
        name: bob

    But if the current offset of <group-id> on the topic users-with-headers is 2
    And if <group-id> == users-with-headers-group-id-replay => we resume replaying the topic users-with-headers

    Then within 10000ms we have received 4 messages on the topic users-with-headers
    Examples:

  Scenario Template: we can assert that a message has been sent on a topic (repeatedly)
    When this user is published on the exposed-users topic:
      """yml
      id: 1
      name: bob

    And the exposed-users topic contains 1 user

  Scenario: we can assert that no message has been sent to a topic

  Scenario: we can assert that a topic will contain a message sent asynchronously
    When after 100ms this user is published on the exposed-users topic:
      """yml

    Then the exposed-users topic contains 1 user

  Scenario: we can use an avro schema having an array of primitives
    Given this avro schema:

    Then the stuffs topic contains 1 stuff

  Scenario: we specify that the messages have to be successfully consumed by the listener (without throwing an expection)
    Given that the message counter will success, error then success
    And these json messages are successfully consumed from the json-users-input topic:
      | id | name    |
      | 1  | bob     |
      | 2  | patrick |
      | 3  | carlo   |
    Then we have received 3 messages on the topic json-users-input

  Scenario: we can actively wait for a topic to be fully consumed
    Given that the message counter will success, error then success
    And these json messages are published on the json-users-input topic:
      | id | name    |
      | 1  | bob     |
      | 2  | patrick |

    When the users-group-id group id has fully consumed the json-users-input topic
    Then we have received 2 messages on the topic json-users-input
